<h1>My C++ labs consists of the following programs: </h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Upper.cpp:</h3></br>This following program takes in a number of strings and convert them to their upper case variants.</br></br>
Input:</br>
The first line of input is a single number N, which specifies how many strings is inputted to
the program. N lines of input follow, with a single string on each line. The assumption is that the
strings do not contain spaces.</br>
Output:</br>
For each string received, the program outputs the input after it is converted to upper case.
</li>
<li>
<h3>prime2.cpp</h3></br> <p>A prime number is a number that has no positive divisors, aside from 1 and itself. A twin prime
is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime. The Twin Prime Conjecture,
attributed by some to Euclid (circa 300 BC), proposes that there are an infinite number of twin
primes. This is still an open problem in Number Theory.</p>
The following program takes in a number of integers and determine whether they are twin
primes.
</br></br>
Input:</br>
The first line of input is a single number N, which specifies how many positive integers will be
input to the program. N lines of input follow, with a single positive integer on each line.The assumption is each integer is greater than 2.</br>
Output</br>
For each number, output true if it is a twin prime. Otherwise, output false.
