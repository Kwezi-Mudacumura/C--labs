<h1>My C++ labs consists of the following programs: </h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Upper:</h3></br>This following program takes in a number of strings and convert them to their upper case variants.</br>
Input:</>br>
The first line of input is a single number N, which specifies how many strings is inputted to
the program. N lines of input follow, with a single string on each line. The assumption is that the
strings do not contain spaces.</br>
Output:</br>
For each string received, the program outputs the input after it is converted to upper case.
